The objective of this project is to develop a visualization that explores stroke incidence across different age groups among males and females, utilizing data from the *Women’s Imaging of Stroke Hemodynamics Study*. This analysis seeks to identify trends and patterns in stroke incidence by age and biological sex, as documented in existing literature.

The project was developed in the statistical programming environment R.
