The goal of this project is to create a visualization that examines stroke incidence across various age groups between males and females, using a dataset from the *Women’s Imaging of Stroke Hemodynamics Study*. This analysis aims to uncover trends and patterns in stroke incidence by age and biological sex.

The project was developed in the statistical programming environment R.
